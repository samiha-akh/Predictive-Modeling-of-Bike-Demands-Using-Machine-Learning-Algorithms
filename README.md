# Predictive-Modeling-of-Bike-Demands-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

# Description
The project contains an analysis of the high bike and low bike demand for Capital
Bikeshare which is a 24-hour public bicycle-sharing system that serves Washington,
D.C. This project uses temporal and meteorological data to predict the need for
additional bikes. A variety of classification algorithms, including logistic regression,
linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors,
and random forests, were evaluated. Random forest provided the highest accuracy
and was chosen for deployment.
